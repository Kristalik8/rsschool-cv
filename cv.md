## About myself
I want to stay a frontend developer.  
I'm quite ambitious. I can learn by myself. 
I worked design engineer at JSC "Minskmetroproekt" for two and a half years.
At my last work, I acquired and strengthened my skills, for about: self-study, teamwork, search and use of information, self-discipline.


## Skills
* HTML;
* CSS;
* Git, GitHub;
* JavaScript (basics);

## Code Example:
**DESCRIPTION:**
_The goal is to create a function of two inputs number and power, that "raises" the number up to power (ie multiplies number by itself power times)._

*Examples: numberToPower(3, 2)  // -> 9 ( = 3 * 3 )*

*Note: Math.pow and some other Math functions like eval() and ** are disabled.*


**My code:**
````
function numberToPower(number, power){
let s = 1;
for (let i = 0; i <power; i++){
s *= number;
}
return s;
}
````
